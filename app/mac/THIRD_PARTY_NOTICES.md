## Bundled Python and OpenSSL

The app embeds a stripped CPython built by
[python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone)
(MIT build tooling). CPython itself is distributed under the PSF License
Agreement, whose full text ships inside the bundle at
`Contents/Resources/swe/python/lib/python3.13/LICENSE.txt`. The OpenSSL
libraries CPython links ship under the Apache License 2.0; their license
ships beside it as `Contents/Resources/swe/python/lib/OPENSSL-LICENSE.txt`.

## References without copied code

AIUsage (Apache 2.0, the per-file cursor with inode, size, mtime, offset and
fingerprints) and TokenTracker (MIT, its notes on Claude sub-agent
over-counting, Codex cached input, and Devin's `request_id` identity) informed
the design. No code was copied from either.

## Harness logos

`Sources/SWECore/Resources/harness-*.svg` are the logos of the coding
harnesses and providers SWE lists, imported by
`script/import-harness-icons.py`: Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Qwen,
Mistral, Antigravity, Command Code, Qoder CN and Ark keep their brand colours
(`harness-<id>-color.svg`), the rest are single-colour marks. Every logo is a trademark of its owner
and is used only to name that harness; none of them implies endorsement.
Where each came from is in `Resources/harness-icons.tsv`:

- Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Grok, Kiro, Devin, OpenCode, Kilo,
  Pi, Antigravity, Kimi, ZCode, Command Code, Qoder, Qoder CN and Volcano
  Engine Ark come from TokenTracker (`dashboard/public/brand-logos` and
  `ProviderIcon.jsx`), most of them extracted there from LobeHub icons.
- Claude's colour mark, Qwen, Mistral, goose, Cline and the API key
  provider marks (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Z.ai, Yi, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo,
  StepFun, Groq, Upstage, Cerebras, OpenRouter, Together AI, Fireworks
  AI, Vercel, Nebius, Cohere, Perplexity, GitHub, Hugging Face, NVIDIA
  and Cloudflare) and the model-lab marks
  for Meta and Ant Group come from LobeHub icons
  (`@lobehub/icons-static-svg`).
- The inference plan and API provider marks for Tencent Cloud, Baidu
  Cloud, Huawei Cloud, iFlytek, SenseNova, KwaiKAT, Ollama, Poe, ZenMux,
  ElevenLabs and Atlas Cloud come from LobeHub icons
  (`@lobehub/icons-static-svg`), as do the status-page marks for
  AssemblyAI, Baseten, Lambda, Mistral AI, Stability AI, AI21, SambaNova,
  Windsurf, Replit, Manus, Lovable, Tavily, Morph, Anyscale, Langfuse and
  v0. Synthetic,
  CheapestInference, Standard
  Compute, TaoToken, JD Cloud, State Cloud (China Telecom), SCNet, Charm,
  LLM Gateway and UCloud come from each company's own site or brand kit;
  China Unicom's from its logo file on English Wikipedia; Moore Threads'
  is traced from its site's PNG, as no vector version is published. These
  are trademarks of their owners, used only to name them; where each came
  from is in `harness-icons.tsv`.
- npm, Homebrew, Nix and uv come from Simple Icons (simple-icons,
  CC0-1.0), as do the status-page marks for Docker, Sentry, Datadog,
  Supabase, DigitalOcean, Render, Upstash, Convex, Linear, Notion, Clerk
  and Twilio (Twilio's is pinned to simple-icons 13.21.0, the last
  release carrying it), Deepgram, Warp, Bitbucket, CircleCI, Buildkite,
  Travis CI, Netlify, Fly.io, PyPI, RubyGems, MongoDB, Prisma, Postman,
  Mailgun, Atlassian, Grafana, New Relic, ngrok, Figma, Discord,
  HashiCorp, Expo, RevenueCat, Snyk, Codecov, Linode (Akamai's mark),
  Sanity, Contentful, Temporal, Maven Central (the Apache Maven
  feather), StackBlitz (the bolt Bolt.new's mark reuses), Braintrust,
  ClickHouse, CockroachDB (Cockroach Labs), Loom, Make, PlanetScale,
  Prefect, Semaphore, Snowflake, Sonatype and Zapier; Routing.Run's
  planet mark from Phosphor Icons (`@phosphor-icons/core`, MIT).
- The remaining status-page marks come from each company's own site,
  brand page or logo file: E2B, Ona, Pinecone, Runloop, Writer,
  Supermemory, incident.io, LaunchDarkly, Inngest, Astronomer, Cartesia,
  Browserbase, Arcade, Statsig, WorkOS and Honeycomb — several cropped to
  the symbol where the site ships only a wordmark — and Sourcegraph's
  swirl from its WorldVectorLogo copy. crates.io publishes no vector
  mark, so its row carries the Rust logo from rust-lang/rust-artwork,
  CC-BY-4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). All are
  trademarks of their owners, used only to name
  them; where each came from is in `harness-icons.tsv`.
- Continue comes from its repository (continuedev/continue,
  `docs/logo/light.svg`); aider from its repository (Aider-AI/aider,
  Apache-2.0, the site's pinned-tab icon); Crush from the
  charmbracelet/crush repository (FSL-1.1-MIT); Droid (Factory), Forge,
  Augment, Blackbox and Freebuff from each product's own site. The
  Apache-2.0 and FSL-1.1-MIT texts follow at the end of this file.
- Featherless's current mark is composed locally: the rebranded F from
  the inline SVG on featherless.ai, on its favicon's yellow tile; the
  site states no licence, so the mark is trademark-only like the rest.
- Tailscale's dot-grid mark comes from tailscale.com's favicon (the
  squircle plate it sits on is dropped), and Artificial Analysis's
  geometric mark from the inline SVG in artificialanalysis.ai's header;
  both are trademark-only like the rest.
- The `tool-*.svg` marks Settings draws for uninstalled terminals and
  editors — Ghostty, iTerm2, WezTerm, Cursor, Zed, VSCodium and Xcode —
  come from Simple Icons (simple-icons, CC0-1.0); Visual Studio Code's
  ribbon from devicons/devicon (MIT). Gram's mark (`tool-gram.png`) is
  its own app icon, and Devin's editor entry reuses the bundled Devin
  harness mark. All are trademarks of their owners, used only to name
  them.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages) as a result of this License or any
      claim of liability or other legal damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
