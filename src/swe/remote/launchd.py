"""Run the hub as a macOS LaunchAgent, so it outlives a restart.

A hub started from a shell (``nohup swe remote serve &``) dies with the
login session and nothing brings it back: the phone then shows "Can't
reach the hub" until someone notices. ``swe remote serve --install``
writes a per-user LaunchAgent that starts the hub at login and restarts
it whenever it exits. The agent runs ``serve --tailnet``, which exits
instead of falling back to localhost while Tailscale is still coming up,
so launchd retries until the tailnet address exists.

The agent runs SWE.app's bundled ``swe`` when the app is installed.
macOS privacy protection blocks a launchd agent from reading ~/Desktop,
~/Documents and ~/Downloads, so a repo checkout's ``.venv/bin/swe`` there
dies at startup ("Operation not permitted" on ``pyvenv.cfg``). The
bundle lives in Applications, and the app's own folder access covers it.

Logic only: callers print. ``run`` is injectable so tests never touch
the real launchctl. ``label`` lets the MCP gateway (``swe mcp gateway
install``) run as its own agent through the same code.
