"""Per-session seq-numbered event journal — the reconnect story.

Every event the hub emits lands in ``data/remote/journal/<slug>.jsonl``
with a per-session ``seq``. A client that was offline for half an hour
rejoins its SSE stream with ``?last=<seq>`` and replays the gap instead of
refetching a transcript — the same thing Claude Remote Control's
server-side transcript buys them, except ours never leaves the tailnet.

The journal is a ring: appends past ``RING_MAX`` events or
``RING_MAX_BYTES`` rewrite the file keeping the newest ``RING_KEEP``
events, at most ``RING_KEEP_BYTES`` of them. Clients that fell off the back of the
ring get ``truncated: true`` in the replay header and refetch history
through ``/v1/sessions/{id}/messages``.
