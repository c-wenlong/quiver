"""Where each harness declares its hooks, and what it declares.

A script under ``~/.quiver/hooks/<harness>/`` does nothing until the
harness's own settings file names it: ``~/.claude/settings.json`` carries a
``hooks`` map, ``~/.codex/hooks.json`` is that same map at its top level,
``~/.cursor/hooks.json`` spells the same idea flat. Two shapes cover them,
keyed by the contract's ``schema`` in ``contracts.py``:

  grouped — ``{Event: [{matcher?, hooks: [{type, command, timeout?}]}]}``
  flat    — ``{Event: [{command, timeout?, matcher?}]}`` (cursor)

Muse indirections once more: its settings file names no hooks at all, it
points at a managed file through ``managed_hooks_path`` — the contract's
``managed_hooks_key`` says which field to follow.

Discovery mirrors ``hook_root``'s rule: ``capabilities.hooks.settings`` in
harness.json wins first (one path or a list, each ``~/``-relative or
absolute); without it, ``SETTINGS_FALLBACK`` holds the files the contract
registry records, and the basenames are probed beside the hooks root for
a harness that declared only ``capabilities.hooks.root``.

Everything here tolerates: a missing file, unparseable JSON, and schema
drift (``hooks`` that is not a dict, groups that are not lists, entries
that are not objects) each read as no declarations, never an error.

The one write is ``drop_script_declarations``: Doctor's "Drop the
declaration" runs it, and only after ``declaration_managed_elsewhere``
clears the file (a symlinked or unwritable file is owned by whatever
manages it) and a backup lands in ~/.quiver/backups. Everything else is
read-only.
