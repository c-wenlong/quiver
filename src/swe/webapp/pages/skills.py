"""The Skills page: ``swe skills --json`` built in process, less the skills
that ship inside a plugin (the Plugins page lists those), and one skill's
detail: its frontmatter, its SKILL.md and its folder's files.

Writes: Link to shared skills, Unlink and Link all, per harness skills
folder, as the Mac app's Harness links popover offers them, and New skill
(``post`` below). Frontmatter edits stay in ``swe skills`` and the Mac
app; see docs/web-app/skills.md.

``GET /v1/app/skills`` is the list. ``?skill=<path>`` is one skill's
detail, and ``?skill=<path>&file=<name>`` one file inside its folder. The
skill must be one the inventory lists, and the file must stay inside the
skill's folder once symlinks resolve, so no request reads anything else.

#
# - ``link`` ``{"harness", "expect"?, "skill"?}``: point the folder at
#   ~/.swe/skills, as the Mac app's "Link to shared skills" does
#   (``swe skills link <path> [--force] --json``). Only a Not linked folder
#   (create, relink, absorb) is linked; ``--force`` is passed only for an
#   absorb folder (copies of shared skills, or a tree with no file in it),
#   which link_skill_root backs up first. keep, conflict, ignored and skipped are refused with
#   the reason, so a folder holding the only copy of a skill is never
#   replaced. An archived folder can be linked here, as in the app.
# - ``unlink`` ``{"harness", "expect"?, "skill"?}``: remove a Linked
#   folder's symlink (``swe skills unlink <path> --json``).
# - ``link_all`` ``{"harnesses"?, "skill"?}``: link every folder
#   ``link_all_targets`` clears (never archived, never one needing
#   ``--force``), one at a time; a failure is reported and the rest go on.
#   ``harnesses`` limits it to the folders the page's confirm named.
#
# ``harness`` is a folder's path (a name works when one folder has it).
# ``expect`` is the state the page showed and ``expect_detail`` its detail
# (an empty folder that fills with shared copies stays ``absorb`` but now
# needs a backup): when the folder has changed since, nothing is written
# and the refusal says what it is now. ``skill``
# is the skill whose detail is open; the reply carries its row again.
#
# The reply is the list payload (``listing``) read after the write, plus
# ``action``, ``harness`` (the folder's new row), ``result`` (the
# LinkReply/UnlinkReply ``--json`` shape, or for link_all
# ``{"linked", "failed", "skipped"}``) and ``skill``.
#
# - ``new`` ``{"name", "description"?}``: ``swe skills new <name>
#   [--description=...]`` (``skills.create.create``), which writes
#   ``~/.swe/skills/<name>/SKILL.md``. A name or description it refuses
#   is a 422 ``bad_skill`` with its reason. The reply is the list payload
#   plus ``action`` and ``created``: the new SKILL.md's path and its row
