"""Persistent per-file parse cache for session listings.

A listing reads every transcript on disk, but between two listings almost
none of them change. This cache keeps what a parser extracted from one file,
keyed by the file's absolute path, and hands it back while the file's stat
signature is unchanged, so an unchanged file costs one ``stat`` instead of a
read and a JSON parse per line.

Rules that keep it from ever showing a stale session:

- **The signature is taken before the read.** A file written between the
  ``stat`` and the read is stored under the older signature, so the next run
  sees a mismatch and reads it again. The other order would pin old content
  to a new signature for good.
- **The signature is (size, mtime_ns, ctime_ns, inode).** ``ctime`` moves on
  every content change and cannot be set back from userland, so a write that
  restores the old mtime (``touch -m``, ``cp -p``) still invalidates; an
  atomic replace changes the inode.
- **Only what a file says is cached.** Anything a parser derives from other
  state (a sidecar index, a sqlite store, whether a directory exists, the
  clock) is applied after the lookup, on every run, or keyed by that
  sidecar's own path.
- **Any code change discards it.** The header holds a format version, the
  package version and a hash of the modules whose logic produced the
  values, so an upgrade or an edit cannot serve results from older code.
- **Any read problem is a miss.** A missing, corrupt or foreign cache file
  reads as empty; an entry with the wrong shape is ignored.

Caching only happens inside ``activate()``, which the aggregator opens around
a listing. Parsers called anywhere else compute every time, exactly as
before. When the block closes, entries for files a harness's parser no
longer visited are pruned, but only for harnesses whose parser ran to
completion, so an ``--agent`` filtered run leaves the others alone.

``standalone()`` opens the same kind of store in a file of its own, with
its own deciding modules, for a caller outside a listing (the status
column's tail reads). Its entries go only once their file is gone.
