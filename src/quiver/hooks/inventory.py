"""The join ``swe hooks`` renders: hub scripts x link state x declarations.

``plan_hooks`` says where each ``~/.quiver/hooks/<harness>/<script>`` should
land and what state the link is in; ``settings.py`` says which of those
scripts the harness will actually run. One row per script x destination.

The drift checks read the same join the other way: declarations that point
at nothing on disk, hub scripts linked but never declared, hub scripts the
destination never received. Hooks owned by other installers (herdr writes
into ``~/.claude/hooks``) are not drift — they live at the destination
without a hub copy, which is exactly the shape ``init/hooks.py``'s
docstring describes — so a finding needs the script to be missing from
*both* the hub and the destination, or unverifiable paths to stay silent.

Nothing in this module prints.
