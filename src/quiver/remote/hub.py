"""The hub: REST + SSE over ``http.server``, device auth, event fan-out.

Stdlib-only by design — SSE is a held HTTP GET, so no WebSocket
dependency enters the tree. ``HubState`` is the reusable core: the
catalog refreshes sessions, the tail manager turns transcripts into
events, and one ``emit`` funnel writes every event to the journal and
the subscriber bus. The satellite agent builds the same core minus the
listener.

Auth: every ``/v1/*`` route except ``/v1/status`` and ``/v1/pair`` wants
``Authorization: Bearer <device credential>`` from ``devices.json``.
The approval POST alone also accepts a scoped, single-use ntfy action
token (``notify.ApprovalTokens``) so a notification never carries a
full-power credential.
